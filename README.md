## 📚 Overview

Welcome to the world of simplicity and efficiency in [LibGdx](https://libgdx.com/) development!
This library is designed to streamline your journey in creating LibGdx projects.
By providing a foundational implementation of key LibGdx features, we free you from the complexities of project configuration.
This way, you can focus your efforts on crafting content specific to your simulation, without getting bogged down in technical details.

In essence, this library acts as a bridge, abstracting and implementing essential features.
Its role is to empower you to concentrate on building simulation-specific content, rather than grappling with the intricacies of project setup.

But that's not all. This library is the bedrock upon which other OIS products are built:
* [OIS Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/attiasas/ois-gradle-plugin) - A Gradle plugin designed for the development, execution, and deployment of OIS simulation projects.

Join us on this journey to simplify your development process and create amazing simulations with ease.

## 🐞 Reporting Issues

We highly recommend running Gradle with the ```-d```
option to get useful and readable debug information if something goes wrong with your build.
